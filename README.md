From paper "Unveiling the relevant electron transfer pathways in nitrite reductases: Hydrogen bond versus backbone"

We include the .fdf files at 0 V to:
1) Original system (cys-his.fdf)
2) With the dihedral angle changed: -10°, -5°, +5°, +10° (cys-his-10°.fdf, cys-his-5°.fdf, cys-his+5°.fdf, cys-his+10°.fdf)
3) Both reduced models: just back bone pathway and just hydrogen-bond pathway (backbone.fdf, hydrogenbond.fdf)
